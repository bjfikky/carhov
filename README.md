# Carhov
Carhov is a modern carpooling application designed to bridge the gap 
between drivers and passengers, making commuting more efficient, 
cost-effective, and environmentally friendly. The platform allows 
users to create and join rides effortlessly by leveraging real-time 
geolocation, secure payment integration, and smart matching algorithms. 

Whether you're a driver with empty seats or a passenger looking for a 
convenient ride, Carhov streamlines the process with an intuitive
interface and powerful backend services built on Spring Boot. 
Users can easily search for rides based on their origin, destination, and 
timing preferences, making daily commuting or intercity travel a seamless experience.

## JTE

This project has been configured to use [JTE precompiled templates](https://jte.gg/pre-compiling/).

However, to ease development, those are not enabled out of the box.
For production deployments, you should remove

```properties
gg.jte.development-mode=true
```

from the `application.properties` file and set

```properties
gg.jte.use-precompiled-templates=true
```

instead.
For more details, please take a look at [the official documentation](https://jte.gg/spring-boot-starter-3/).

### Testcontainers support

This project
uses [Testcontainers at development time](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/3.4.1/reference/features/dev-services.html#features.dev-services.testcontainers).

Testcontainers has been configured to use the following Docker images:

* [`postgres:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)

Please review the tags of the used images and set them to the same as you're running in production.

### Maven Parent overrides

Due to Maven's design, elements are inherited from the parent POM to the project POM.
While most of the inheritance is fine, it also inherits unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the
parent.
To prevent this, the project POM contains empty overrides for these elements.
If you manually switch to a different parent and actually want the inheritance, you need to remove those overrides.
